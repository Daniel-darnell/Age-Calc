# Age-Calc

Age-Calc a web-application a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.

Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. That is where Age-Calc comes in to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.
